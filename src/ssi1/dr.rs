As data values are removed by the receive logic from the incoming data frame, they are placed into the entry in the receive FIFO, pointed to by the current FIFO write pointer. When written, the entry in the transmit FIFO, pointed to by the write pointer, is written to. Data values are removed from the transmit FIFO one value at a time by the transmit logic. It is loaded into the transmit serial shifter, then serially shifted out onto the TXD output pin at the programmed bit rate. When a data size of less than 16 bits is selected, the user must right-justify data written to the transmit FIFO. The transmit logic ignores the unused bits. Received data less than 16 bits is automatically right-justified in the receive buffer.\n\nThis register you can [`read`](crate::generic::Reg::read), [`write_with_zero`](crate::generic::Reg::write_with_zero), [`reset`](crate::generic::Reg::reset), [`write`](crate::generic::Reg::write), [`modify`](crate::generic::Reg::modify).
