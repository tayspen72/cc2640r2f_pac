Transmit interrupt status: This field returns the raw interrupt state of UART's transmit interrupt. When FIFOs are enabled (LCRH.FEN = 1), the transmit interrupt is asserted if the number of bytes in transmit FIFO is equal to or lower than the programmed trigger level (IFLS.TXSEL). The transmit interrupt is cleared by writing data to the transmit FIFO until it becomes greater than the trigger level, or by clearing the interrupt through ICR.TXIC. When FIFOs are disabled (LCRH.FEN = 0), that is they have a depth of one location, the transmit interrupt is asserted if there is no data present in the transmitters single location. It is cleared by performing a single write to the transmit FIFO, or by clearing the interrupt through ICR.TXIC."]

The raw interrupt for receive timeout cannot be set unless the mask is set (IMSC.RTIM = 1). This is because the mask acts as an enable for power saving.
