Note 2: Data value is only sampled for accesses that do not fault (MPU or bus fault). The PC is sampled irrespective of any faults. The PC is only sampled for the first address of a burst. Note 3: PC match is not recommended for watchpoints because it stops after the instruction. It mainly guards and triggers the ETM."]
